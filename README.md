# SDL2_Game
Game based on SDL2 rendering library

Brick breaker is an unfinished but working reproduction of the old game from the same name using SDL_2 library

Priject 1 is just a testing surface for another game far from being finished but for the curious ones it will be a digitalised version of carcassone
